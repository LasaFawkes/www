	<h1>What is Turtl?</h1>
	<p>
		It's a <em>private place</em> to keep your notes, bookmarks, passwords, ideas,
		dream logs, photos, documents and anything else you want kept safe. Turtl's easy
		<em>tagging and filtering</em> make it ideal for organization and research
		whether for personal or professional projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Think of Turtl as Evernote with ultimate privacy.
	</p>

	<h1>How is it private?</h1>
	<p>
		Turtl takes your password from when you sign up and
		uses it to create a <em>cryptographic key</em>. It uses this key to
		encrypt your data before storing it anywhere on your device or on our
		servers. Neither your password nor your key are ever stored anywhere.
		This means that <em>only you and those you choose to share with can read
		your data.</em>
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>

	<h1>Can I share with others?</h1>
	<p>
		Yes! Turtl lets you share with others and does so in a way that keeps
		your unshared data safe. You control what you share with others and
		everything else stays completely private.
	</p>

	<h1>Why did you build it?</h1>
	<p>
		<em>Because privacy should be easy.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now is a very important time in history. Every aspect of our lives is moving
		into the digital world faster than we realize. We use apps like
		Dropbox or Evernote because of their convenience, but in doing so we
		sacrifice our privacy. What data isn't <em>sold to advertisers</em> or
		<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/04/tech/web/evernote-hacked/">stolen by hackers</a>
		is carved up by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)">government surveillance</a>.
		The only way to keep private data private is to either not put it online
		at all or encrypt it. Encrypting your data can be a big pain. The tools
		are difficult to learn and one mistake renders all your work useless.
	</p>
	<p>
		Turtl fixes all this. It incorporates the best cryptographic practices
		with a beautiful interface that makes you forget you're using an
		encrypted app. Best of all, it was built from the ground up to allow
		you to share with others, so you can collaborate together securely.
	</p>

	<h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
	<p>
		The hosted Turtl service is completely free until your profile grows
		past a certain size or you require certain features.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="/premium">See our pricing page &raquo;</a>
	</p>

	<h1>Is it open source?</h1>
	<p>
		Yes. All of Turtl's source code for its clients and server are available
		online <a href="https://github.com/turtl">on our Github</a>. Turtl's
		code is licensed GPLv3, meaning anybody can download and run their own
		version personally or in their company's intranet.
