# Overview
{{toc}}

Turtl is made up of notes and boards. A note can be text, a link or bookmark, an
image, and in the near future, a file. Notes are what actually holds your data,
no matter what it is.

A board is a collection of notes. It can be a collection of bookmarks, a TODO
list, an idea board, a shopping wishlist, or anything else you can think of that
will help you organize your notes.
