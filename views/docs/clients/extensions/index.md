# Browser bookmarking extensions

The browser extensions allow easy and secure bookmarking. They do this by first
pairing with the desktop app, which consists of copying a hex-based key from a
popup window in the desktop app to the extension. After pairing, the extension
is able to send bookmarking data directly to the desktop app (encrypted) using
its native [HTTP server](/docs/clients/desktop/index#http-server).
