## [Roadmap and planned features](https://github.com/turtl/js/issues)
Turtl has a very clear picture of its [next steps and features](https://github.com/turtl/js/issues)
on Github. Note that a lot of planned featured are not tracked on the issue
tracker on Github in order to keep it concise and organized. These features
and issues are tracked internally by the Turtl team, and are added to the Github
issue tracker as they become relevant.

Doing things this way provides a clear picture of what we're working on in the
next few releases and what features we have planned down the road.

If you have an idea for how we can make Turtl better (or a bug report), do not
hesitate to let us know [on the discussion board](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/turtl)
or [contact us](/contact) via email/twitter.
