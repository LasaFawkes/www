What is it?
===========

Turtl is an application that allows you to store notes, bookmarks, and files
and access them from anywhere. Turtl uses AES encryption for personal data, and
RSA shared-key encryption when sending data between users.

Turtl is open-source (both the [client](https://github.com/lyonbros/turtl-js)
and the [server](https://github.com/lyonbros/turtl-api)) allowing anybody to
audit the source or run their own version.

It is distributed as a browser add-on because implementing it as a website
introduces security holes that could compromise your data.

The philosophy
==============

The idea behing Turtl is that at any given moment, someone could break into the
database and steal all the data...and this would be just fine. Be it hackers or
government agencies, without your username and password, your data is a heap of
rubbish to anyone looking at it.

Obviously we go to great lengths to keep your data (encrypted or not) safe from
prying eyes, but the point is that your data is meaningless without the keys
that only you hold.

Why use encryption?
===================

"I have nothing to hide." Well, would you use a public bathroom with glass
walls?

Just because you aren't storing harmful or illegal things doesn't mean you want
the world seeing your thoughts, pictures, files, or ideas.

How much does it cost?
======================

Right now, Turtl is free. It will always be a free download and free to use, but
eventually we plan to offer premium features as well as charge per-gigabyte of
storage used.
