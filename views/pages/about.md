What is Turtl?
==============

Turtl is an app you can use to store files and notes. It can help keep track of
research, photos, bookmarks, playlists, and anything else you can think of.
Turtl uses client-side encryption to keep everything you put into it private
while still allowing you to access your data from anywhere.

Turtl is [open-source](https://github.com/turtl), allowing anybody to audit the
source or run their own version. See the [project timeline](https://github.com/turtl/js/issues/milestones)
to get a sense for what's to come.

For more information, head over to the [Turtl documentation](/docs).

The philosophy
==============

We believe you should have control over who has access to your data. This is a
real problem: with increasing threats from hackers and government surveillance,
how can you trust the online services that store your private information? The
idea behind Turtl is that _you shouldn't have to._

We've set up our service so that only _you_ have the keys to your data and it
gets encrypted _before_ it leaves your computer. That way, even if the NSA
wiretaps your Internet connection, even if an army of mercenaries storms our
data-center and steals our hard drives, your data is unreadable to everyone,
including us.

Because it's nobody else's business but yours.

Turtl is beta
=============

Turtl is <strong>beta</strong>. Neither its security architecture or the code
supporting it have been evaluated by security professionals.

*Please do not trust Turtl's security with your life*.
