What is Turtl?
==============

Turtl is an app you can use to store notes and files. It can help keep track of
research, photos, bookmarks, playlists, and anything else you can think of.
Turtl uses client-side encryption to keep everything you put into it private
while still allowing you to access your data from anywhere.

Turtl is [open-source](https://github.com/turtl), allowing anybody to audit the
source or run their own version. See the [project timeline](https://github.com/turtl/js/issues/milestones)
to get a sense for what's to come.

For more information, head over to the [Turtl documentation](/docs).

The philosophy
==============

We believe you should have control over who has access to your data. This is a
real problem: with increasing threats from hackers and government surveillance,
how can you trust the online services that store your private information? The
idea behind Turtl is that _you shouldn't have to._

We've set up our service so that only _you_ have the keys to your data and it
gets encrypted _before_ it leaves your computer. That way, even if the NSA
wiretaps your Internet connection, even if an army of mercenaries storms our
data-center and steals our hard drives, your data is unreadable to everyone,
including us.

Because it's nobody else's business but yours.

Turtl is beta
=============

It works well but may have bugs, annoyances, and security flaws as it finds its
way in life.  Please feel free to discuss any problems you have via our
[discussion board](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/turtl), [our twitter](https://twitter.com/turtlapp),
or [by email](mailto:info@turtl.it).

*Please do not trust Turtl's security with your life*.

__Caution__: Until Turtl is more stable, we're logging errors that occur in the
clients to our servers. This allows us to see what bugs need to be fixed. While
unlikely, it's possible that an error logged to the server contains details
about information you've stored in Turtl.
