What is it?
===========

Turtl is an application that allows you to store notes, bookmarks, (and soon
files) and access them from anywhere. Turtl uses client-side AES encryption for
personal data, and RSA shared-key encryption when sending data between users.

Turtl is [open-source](https://github.com/turtl), allowing anybody to audit the
source or run their own version. See the [project timeline](https://github.com/turtl/js/issues/milestones)
to get a sense for what's to come.

Right now, Turtl is a browser add-on. We're planning on releasing to mobile and
desktop soon, so stay tuned (be sure to follow our [twitter](https://twitter.com/turtlapp)
or check out the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/turtl) to
stay up to date).

The philosophy
==============

We believe you should have control over who has access to your data. This is a
real problem: with increasing threats from hackers and government surveillance,
how can you trust the online services that store your private information? The
idea behind Turtl is that _you shouldn't have to._

We've set up our service so that only _you_ have the keys to your data and it
gets encrypted _before_ it leaves your computer. That way, even if the NSA
wiretaps your Internet connection, even if an army of mercenaries storms our
data-center and steals our hard drives, your data is unreadable to everyone,
including us.

Because it's nobody else's business but yours.

Why use encryption?
===================

"I have nothing to hide." Well, would you use a public bathroom with glass
walls?

Just because you aren't storing harmful or illegal things doesn't mean you want
the world seeing your thoughts, pictures, files, or ideas.

How much does it cost?
======================

Right now, Turtl is free. It will always be a free download and free to use, but
eventually we plan to offer premium features and charge for storage (ala
Dropbox).
