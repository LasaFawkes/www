                Note that <strong>Turtl is in beta</strong>. It works well, but may have issues, bugs, and security flaws as it finds its way in life.
                Please feel free to discuss any problems you have via our <a href="http://groups.google.com/d/forum/turtl">discussion board</a>,
                via <a href="https://twitter.com/turtlapp">our twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:info@turtl.it">by email</a>. Note that file support is
                also <em>very young</em> and needs a chance to mature before you use Turtl for important documents and files.
