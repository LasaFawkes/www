                <p>
                    Turtl makes it easy to organize research for your projects
                    whether you're cataloging inspiration for your next design,
                    tracking libraries and code snippets for the app you're
                    building, or saving sources and ideas for the paper you're
                    writing.

                <h2>Stay secure</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything you put into Turtl is encrypted before being
                    saved. The only way to decrypt it is with your login info
                    which only you know. Turtl takes your privacy seriously,
                    making it a great for security-conscious individuals and
                    small businesses.

                <h2>Collaborate with others</h2>
                <p>
                    Just because your data is private doesn't mean you can't
                    share with others. Collaborate on stealth projects, share
                    sensitive documents, or give your business
                    a private space for people to work together. Turtl uses
                    shared-key encryption to protect your data when
                    collaborating.

                <h2>Open source</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe in transparency. The Turtl source code, for both
                    the clients and the server, is open source
                    <a href="https://github.com/turtl">for anyone to view</a>.
                    Not only does this make Turtl overall more secure, it allows
                    you to run Turtl inside your organization.
