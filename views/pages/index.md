                It works well but may have bugs, annoyances, and security flaws as it finds its way in life.
                Please feel free to discuss any problems you have via our <a href="http://groups.google.com/d/forum/turtl">discussion board</a>,

                <strong>Caution</strong>: Until Turtl is more stable, we're logging errors that occur in the clients to our servers. This allows us to
                see what bugs need to be fixed. While unlikely, it's possible that an error logged to the server contains details about information
                you've stored in Turtl.
