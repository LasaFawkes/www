                    Turtl allows multiple people to share ideas with each other
                    securely.

                    Use Turtl to track and organize research for sensitive
                    topics.

                    No more uploading to "secure" file sharing services. Just
                    put it in Turtl.

            <p>
                It works well for the most part but may have issues, bugs, and security flaws as it finds its way in life.
                Please feel free to discuss any problems you have via our <a href="http://groups.google.com/d/forum/turtl">discussion board</a>,
                via <a href="https://twitter.com/turtlapp">our twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:info@turtl.it">by email</a>. Note that file support is
                also <em>very young</em> and needs a chance to mature before you use Turtl for important documents and files.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Caution</strong>: Until Turtl is more stable, we're logging errors that occur in the clients to our servers. This allows us to
                see what bugs need to be fixed. While unlikely, it's possible that an error logged to the server contains details about information
                you've stored in Turtl.
