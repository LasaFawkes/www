                    Turtl makes it easy to organize research for your projects.
                    Whether you're cataloging inspiration for your next design,
                    tracking libraries and code snippets for the app you're
                    building, or saving sources and ideas for the paper you're
                    writing.

                <h2>Stay secure</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything you put into Turtl is encrypted, and only you
                    hold the keys to unlock your data. Turtl takes your privacy
                    seriously, making it a great for security-conscious
                    individuals and small businesses.<br>

                <h2>Collaborate with others</h2>
                <p>
                    Just because your data is private doesn't mean you can't
                    share with others. Collaborate on stealth projects, share
                    sensitive documents, or give your business
                    a private space for people to work together.

                <h2>Open source</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe in transparency. Turtl's code is open source
                    <a href="https://github.com/turtl">for anyone to view</a>.
                    Not only does this make Turtl overall more secure, it allows
                    you to self-host Turtl inside your organization.
