# Which one do I pick?

The Turtl browser extension gives you a quick way to bookmark websites and
photos, but other than bookmarking, the extension and the desktop app both have
the same features.

One benefit of the desktop app is that it lets you run Turtl on most platforms,
even if you don't use Chrome/Firefox as your main browser.

## [Turtl for Firefox is alpha](/faq#what-s-wrong-with-the-firefox-extension)

While we currently release a Firefox extension, it has been known to have
problems on some platforms due to [issues with Firefox itself](/faq#what-s-wrong-with-the-firefox-extension).
We keep the extension up to date and released with the other clients in case it
will work on your platform.

Although Turtl for Firefox is alpha, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact)
if you have problems with it. It may be something we can solve.
