# Which one do I pick?

The Turtl browser extension gives you a quick way to bookmark websites and
photos, but other than bookmarking, the extension and the desktop app both have
the same features.

One benefit of the desktop app is that it lets you run Turtl on most platforms,
even if you don't use Chrome as your main browser.

## Where's the Firefox extension?

There is a Firefox extension, but it is not officially supported due to
[issues with Firefox itself](/faq#is-there-a-firefox-extension).
