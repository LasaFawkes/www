Terms of service
================

The purpose of this document is to clearly explain the usage contract between
you and the Turtl service. Turtl is a storage utility founded on the principals
of absolute privacy.

## DMCA (copyright or intellectual property violations)

We respond to clear and complete notices of alleged infringement of copyright,
trademark or other intellectual property laws that satisfy the requirements in
these Terms (which we believe to comply with the United States Digital
Millennium Copyright Act [www.copyright.gov] and other applicable laws). If you
believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify
our IP Rights department (ip@turtl.it) and we will investigate. Note that each
owner of intellectual property is responsible for protecting their rights and
taking any legal or other action they determine to be appropriate to do so, and
Turtl does not accept any obligation to take any particular action to enforce or
protect any party's intellectual property rights.
